<!-- Two special attributes in table are row and column span
 
Row span Basically means the number of rows that we wnat to Act as a child under a certain Column


Action attribute is used to define what action needs to be performed when form is submitted on where the form data should be sent


input element must be inside the label element if we want to directly link it

but usually we use the classical approch to carry out this one with the help of for attribute and id attribute 

id is a unique name for a element 

and to connect the label with the input we just need to mention the id of the input inside the for attribute of the label 

by default any button inside of a form act as a submit button 
but if the button is outside of the form then it will act as a null button 

button are most of the time  from one of the 3 types that are submit , button , reset 

sumbit and reset as the name says and the button type will do nothing until js 

input type can also be used to create a button if we mark the type as button and we can use value attribute to mark what will be shown on the button as a text 

Name is the attribute which tell us about the information that a particular input box is carrying inside And to understand it deeply, we can just view our URL of the web page that will display the name as or equal to the value that was entered into the input field And it's not very suggested, because as you can see, it is not one of the most secure way to send or receive data And we will learn how to hide old data later using JavaScript
pari { name = value }

We can create a check box, using HTML by simply changing the type attribute of input element as check Box And if we want it to be already marked as check, then simply add a property, CHECKED into the input type
