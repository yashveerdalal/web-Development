<!-- HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It's a fundamental technology of the web, alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. Here's a comprehensive overview:

1. Basic Concepts
HTML Documents: An HTML document is a file that contains HTML code. Itâ€™s usually saved with a .html or .htm file extension.
Tags: HTML uses tags to define elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., <tagname>. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, <p> and </p> denote the start and end of a paragraph.
Elements: An HTML element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, <h1>Welcome</h1> is an HTML element where <h1> is the start tag, Welcome is the content, and </h1> is the end tag.
Attributes: Tags can have attributes that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are written in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs, e.g., <a href="https://example.com">Link</a>, where href is the attribute and https://example.com is its value.


<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 here).
<html>: The root element of the document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title and link to stylesheets.
<title>: Specifies the title of the webpage, shown in the browser tab.
<body>: Contains the content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.
3. Common HTML Tags
Headings: <h1> to <h6> define headings, with <h1> being the highest level.
Paragraphs: <p> defines a paragraph.
Links: <a href="url">Link text</a> creates a hyperlink.
Images: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"> embeds an image.
Lists: <ul> (unordered list) and <ol> (ordered list) are used with <li> for list items.
Tables: <table>, <tr>, <td>, and <th> are used to create and manage tables.
Forms: <form>, <input>, <textarea>, and <button> are used to create forms for user input.
4. HTML5
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and comes with several new features and elements:

Semantic Elements: New tags like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section> provide more meaning to the structure of a webpage.
Multimedia: <video> and <audio> elements for embedding video and audio files.
Graphics: <canvas> for drawing graphics via JavaScript.
APIs: New APIs for offline storage, local storage, and more.
5. Best Practices
Semantic HTML: Use tags according to their purpose for better accessibility and SEO.
Validation: Ensure your HTML code is valid by using tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service.
Accessibility: Use attributes like alt for images and proper heading levels to enhance accessibility.
6. Resources
MDN Web Docs: Comprehensive documentation on HTML and other web technologies.
W3Schools: Tutorials and references for HTML.
Can I Use: Check browser support for HTML features.
Understanding HTML is crucial for web development, as it provides the foundation upon which CSS and JavaScript build to create interactive and styled websites. If you have any specific questions about HTML or need examples of particular elements, feel free to ask!

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>

  <body>
    <h4>hello world !!</h4>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- 

 paragraph tag will display the elements in the 
 same line
 And will automatically remove all the extra space Present between the opening and the closing tag


 And if we use more than one paragraph tag, then it will break the line and display the content from the beginning of the next line

<!-- HTML is basically based on Hierarchy model -->
<!-- Meta data is stored inside head tag -->
